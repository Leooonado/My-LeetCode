# LeetCode – Data Analytics & Coding Practice
This repository contains my solutions to selected LeetCode problems,
with a focus on **data analytics, business logic, and database-related problems**.

Instead of purely algorithmic classification, problems are organized
by **analytics use cases**, similar to real-world data analysis tasks.

## Tech Stack
- Python (data manipulation, logic implementation)
- SQL (data querying, joins, aggregation)
- R (dplyr-style data transformation)

## Problem Categories

### SQL
- Filtering & Aggregation
- Multi-table Joins
- Subqueries & CTEs
- Time-based Analysis
- Business Metrics (e.g. rankings, percentages)

### Python for Analytics
- Data Manipulation (lists, dicts, grouping)
- Aggregation & Metrics
- Business Logic Translation
- Edge Case Handling

### R for Analytics (There are not that much R problems at LeetCode, might use R for other personal project)
- Data Wrangling with dplyr
- Grouped Summaries
- Pipeline-style Transformations

## Goals
- Strengthen analytics-oriented problem solving
- Improve SQL and data manipulation skills
- Practice translating business questions into code
- Prepare for data analyst / analytics / marketing analytics interviews
- Solve one problem on LeetCode each day!(Goal of 2026)
